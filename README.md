A project for constructing a tool which allows one to"draw" the bytes in a sample for audio production.
Such a sample is intended to be short in length and is intended to be loaded into a program which will can seamlessly loop the sample at a certain frequency to provide a waveform.
The shape of the sample itself generally doesn't affect the pitch of the resulting sound, but this tool is instead meant to be used to construct certain tones.

Simply run `javac SampleDrawer.java` to compile then `java SampleDrawer` to run the application.
